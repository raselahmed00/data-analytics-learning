# Day 1 – Introduction to Data Analytics

A Data Analyst collects, cleans, and analyzes data to help organizations make better decisions.  
They use tools like SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Python to find trends, measure performance, and present insights clearly.

## Tools I Installed

- Kaggle

## My Reflection
I learned that data analysis is not only about numbers but about solving real business problems with data.
